# TDT4250-Project
I don't know if I have anything to show for the project delivery, since everything got deleted while I was experimenting with new eclipse runtime. But before everything got deleted I had created an updateSite which hopefully has the needed information. The updateSite can be found here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hv8r5KPyxOVyzy9sG1qsQvd9jcWasdc_/view?usp=sharing.

To install the updateSite make a new eclipse runtime. Go to help/install new software and add the new updatesite, then follow the instructions. After eclipse has restarted you are supposed to import the model that was in imdb.example and selecting the viewpoint imdb.

This would let you play around with the modeler.

I created a simple graphical dsl using Sirius from an EMF.

The tool could create movies and people and connect the people to the movies through various edges with different properties like an Actor edge connecting
a person to a movie.

I made it possible to delete and reconnect edges as well as styling where every movie with a score above 9.0/10 got a prefix.

The picture of my sirius project can be seen in imdb.png in the root folder.
