# TDT4250-Project
I don't know if I have anything to show for the project delivery.

I created a simple graphical dsl using Sirius from an EMF.

The tool could create movies and people and connect the people to the movies through various edges with different properties like an Actor edge connecting
a person to a movie.

I made it possible to delete and reconnect edges as well as styling where every movie with a score above 9.0/10 got a prefix.
